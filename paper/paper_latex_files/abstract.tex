Monitoring $Escherichia$ $coli$ concentrations in recreational water is crucial for public health and safety. In this project, we applied regression models to U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) datasets from Beach 6 and Huntington Beach, two Great Lakes sites, to predict \textit{E. coli} concentrations from environmental factors. For Beach 6, these factors included turbidity, relative humidity, water temperature, number of birds, lake level change, wind speed, and rainfall. For Huntington Beach, these factors included lake temperature, lake turbidity, wave height, lake level change, and rainfall. Our best models outperformed or matched the published USGS baselines. Although our models achieved statistical success, we believe that the real-life application of the models should be taken with caution.
