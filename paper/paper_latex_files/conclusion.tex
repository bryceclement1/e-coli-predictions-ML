\label{sec:concl}

Our work produces two regression models using machine learning that predict water quality in water bodies around the Great Lakes region. For the Beach 6 dataset, we found that the linear regression model using Ridge produces the most statistically successful result. For the Huntington data, the polynomial regression using Ridge generates a better prediction, as it deals with the interconnected relationships among hyperparameters. We believe that our models could be useful for progressing the water-quality machine learning model for Great Lakes region but should be used with caution when dealing with other more generalized environments. One potential future direction could be standardizing the data collection of water bodies across the Great Lakes region to produce a more generalized model with a wider scope.
