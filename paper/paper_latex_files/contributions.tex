Both B.C. and R.W. did the early exploration and the pre-processing of the data. B.C. experimented with the first few models on the Beach 6 dataset. R.W. experimented with the Huntington dataset for the similar models. B.C. experimented cross-validation and grid search for coefficient tuning and integrated the models together for statistical analyses. R.W. was responsible for writing the textual part of the write-up. Both contributed in making figures and tables. Both have proofread and made final editing of the document upon submission.
